A sequential neural network made up of two dense layers are used as the main backbone of the model. The weights are stored in the `mode.h5` file.

*Tensorflow* with *Keras* is used to achieve this in python. *numpy* is used to help with processing of the image.

The output of the model is overlain on the input image and shown to the user.
